In compute block:

* use find_nearest_point to subset topo
* handle peridiodicity
* build kdtree if lon/lat topo is 2d
* if number of points used to compute stats < threshold (resolution of model gets similar to input data)
  then switch to a nearest neighbor using the indices from kdtree

In top-level:

* subset global topo to area covered by model "block"
* call compute_block on subset of topo
